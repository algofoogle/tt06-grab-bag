# PCB design files for TT06 Grab Bag

*   [`tt06-vga-opamp/`](./tt06-vga-opamp/) is my original prototyping board that I made for testing tt06-grab-bag. I was originally working on it [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/opamp/tt06-vga-opamp) (private repo).
*   [`tt06-vga-interposer/`](./tt06-vga-interposer/) is a board I'm working on that sits between the TT06 chip carrier board and the TT06 demo board. It taps the analog signals relevant to this design and buffers them with an OPA3355, and includes a VGA socket.
